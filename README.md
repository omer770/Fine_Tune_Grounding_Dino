# Grounding DINO Fine-tuning ðŸ¦–


We have expanded on the original DINO  repository 
https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO 
by introducing the capability to train the model with image-to-text grounding. This capability is essential in applications where textual descriptions must align with regions of an image. For instance, when the model is given a caption "a cat on the sofa," it should be able to localize both the "cat" and the "sofa" in the image.
